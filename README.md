# STK Sweep Setup Instructions

This README provides detailed instructions on how to set up the STK Sweep server, as well as usage documentation. Follow these steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3
- `pip` + `virtualenv`
- `rtl-sdr` package, including `rtl_tcp` and `rtl_power`

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Source Code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fosatech/STK-Sweep.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd STK-Sweep/
   ```

3. **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Flask Application:**
   ```bash
   python stk_sweep.py
   ```
   Note: this currently starts the Flask development server.

## Docker

TODO: Setup USB passthrough to access SDR devices

Current draft Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files have been added to the repo.

To build and run application run the following command
```bash
docker compose run --publish 5000:5000 stk_sweep
```

## Usage

After completing the setup, the Flask application will be running on your local server. You can access it via `localhost:5000/rtl_data`.

1. Enter the desired wideband scan range and bin size and start the scan.

2. Start the `rtl_tcp` server with the desired port and IP, and connect to it with your SDR software.

3. `ctrl + left click` on a frequency and STK Sweep will automatically tune your 2nd SDR to it.

## Settings and Configuration

**Wideband Settings:**

Enter the freqency range, gain, and bin size.

- Gain should be between 0-50, or "automatic".
- The bin size is in Hz, and sets the frequency range that each pixel covers. Lower bin size, more resolution.
- The reccomended bin size is 0.12% of your bandwidth. A simple way to calculate this is `<bw in MHz> * 0.12`. This will give you the optimal bin size in kHz.

**Waterfall Display Settings:**

This sets the color profile for each new row of the waterfall. Future versions will update the entire waterfall color scheme.

The `Activity Threshold` slider sets the threshold for the activity bar.

**RTL TCP Settings:**

This is for starting the backend `rtl_tcp` server. `STK Sweep` has a TCP proxy on the backend in order to be able to update the center frequency of the 2nd RTL-SDR dongle.

## Contributing

Contributions to the SDR-STK project are welcome. Please read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to contribute.

## To-Do

**Bug Fixes:**
- ~~Frontend breaks with really wide scan~~
- ~~Buttons don't turn red on `stop`~~
- ~~Exception catches on backend~~
- Large `bin` size breaks `drawRow()` in `rtlDataDisplay.js`
- Implement proper server like `gunicorn` without `rtl_tcp` proxy lagging
- ~~Remove old requirements~~
- Detect when scan or tcp server is stoppen on backend
- ~~Properly kill tcp proxy before initial connection~~
- Fix broken sliders on some browsers (Brave, Opera)

**Aditional Features:**
- Convince entire population of earth to use Linux || Add Windoze support
- Custom wideband backend
- Zoom and scroll relative to page center/mouse cursor
- Save scan files to disk
- Add documentation
- ~~Add license~~
- Add usage docs
- Add more `rtl_power` options
- Add page settings
- Update entire waterfall colors
- Proper waterfall schema
- Multiple waterfall color options
- Automatic gain on frontent
- Multiple concurrent widebands
- Multiple concurrent rtl_tcp outputs
- Proper mobile browser support
